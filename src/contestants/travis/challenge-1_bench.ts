/**
 * The Product Catalog Challenge
 * 
 * You have a catalog of products stored in an JSON array at this file:
 * - 'src/assets/challenge-1/challenge-1-product-catalog.json'
 * 
 * Each product has properties like id, name, category, price, tags, etc. See file for more info. 
 * 
 * Write a function that efficiently finds all products that:
 * - Belong to the following category: 'Food & Beverages'
 * - Have the tag: 'organic'
 * - Fall within a price range of: $50 - $150
 */


/**
 * EXPLAIN YOUR APPROACH AND METHODS HERE
 * My idea was to keep the function relatively simple by using a simple for loop to check for the required parameters and pushing the results to an array to start.
 * Then I would try to optimize the function by adding or removing things that could be improved.
 * 
 * 1. Import the JSON file the same way you would import a file in another part of the application.
 * 2. Create an empty array to store the resutls in.
 * 3. Loop through the products and find products that have the matching parameters above.
 * 4. Log the total number of results found.
 * 5. Log and calculate the average price using a reduce on the results array to get the sum of all the prices and then divide by the length of the results array.
